# Product Philosophy

## Mission

Give people a quiet moment each day to notice how they feel — nothing more.

Not a tool. Not a coach. Not a habit tracker. Just a small, honest pause.

## UX Principles

### 1. One moment, once a day
The app opens, asks one question, and steps aside. There is no second screen to fill, no streak to maintain, no reason to stay longer than you want.

### 2. No interpretation
The app records what you say. It does not explain it, score it, or connect it to anything. Your feelings are yours — they don't need a framework.

### 3. Silence is an answer
Skipping a day is fine. Leaving a note blank is fine. The app never reminds, nudges, or asks where you've been.

### 4. Memory without judgment
History exists so you can look back if you choose. It is presented plainly — dates and what you noted, nothing highlighted, nothing flagged.

### 5. Low cognitive load
Every interaction should feel obvious. No tutorials, no tooltips, no learning curve. If something needs explaining, it's designed wrong.

## Tone of Voice

| Attribute      | We are                        | We are not                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Warmth         | Gentle, unhurried             | Cheerful, enthusiastic         |
| Directness     | Clear, few words              | Vague, wordy                   |
| Emotional range| Accepting of all states       | Optimistic, solution-oriented  |
| Authority      | Absent — we don't lead        | Coaching, advising, suggesting |
| Personality    | Quiet presence                | Friendly companion             |

### Language examples

| ✓ Use                          | ✗ Avoid                              |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| "How are you today?"           | "Let's check in with yourself!"       |
| "Noted."                       | "Great job logging your mood!"        |
| "Your entries"                 | "Your emotional journey"              |
| "Nothing here yet"             | "Start your first check-in!"          |
| "Data removed"                 | "Your slate is clean — fresh start!"  |

The voice should feel like a blank notebook — present, open, and completely without opinion.

## UI Design Philosophy

### Visual identity
- **Color**: Muted, desaturated palette. No bright accents. Backgrounds breathe.
- **Typography**: One typeface, two weights maximum. Generous spacing. Text never competes for attention.
- **Shape**: Soft edges, no hard borders. Elements feel placed, not contained.
- **Motion**: Slow fades and subtle shifts only. Nothing bounces, slides, or draws the eye.
- **Density**: Mostly empty space. Every screen should feel like it has room to spare.

### Interaction model
- Tap-first, type-optional. The primary action is always a single tap.
- No modals, no confirmations for routine actions, no loading spinners. If the app needs time, it simply appears ready when it is.
- Dark mode is not a feature — it's a default consideration. Both palettes should feel equally native.

### Information hierarchy
- The current moment is the only thing that matters. Today's check-in is the whole interface.
- History is reachable but never promoted.
- Settings exist but stay invisible until needed.

## What We Will NOT Do

| Decision                        | Why                                                        |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| No push notifications           | A check-in that interrupts you is not a check-in.          |
| No streaks or counters          | Consistency is not the point. Honesty is.                  |
| No mood trends or graphs        | Patterns imply something should change. We don't go there. |
| No suggested actions            | "Try deep breathing" is advice. We don't give advice.      |
| No social features              | Feelings shared for an audience become performances.        |
| No AI-generated insights        | The app does not know you better than you do.              |
| No onboarding questionnaire     | We don't need to know who you are to let you feel.         |
| No premium tier                 | Monetizing emotional honesty creates wrong incentives.     |
| No branded emotional language   | We don't name your feelings — you do.                      |
| No celebration of "positive" moods | All feelings are equal. None are better.                |
